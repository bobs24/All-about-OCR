1 text extraction : OCR is used to extract text from scanned or photo graphed documents, turning images into machine-readable text
2 data structuring : The extracted text is then analyzed and structured using natural language processing techniques such as names, dates, amount, and organization
3 automated processing : Document understanding through OCR allows for automated processing of large volumes of documents
