5. How are the common architectures of text detection and text recognition models ?

Common architectures for text detection models include Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) and You Only Look Once (YOLO), while for text recognition model, the convolutional recurrent natual network and transformer-based model like the vision transformer
